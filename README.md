# SCARA-Robot
 In this project, kinematic analysis is done using a Robo-analyzer to find out the position of the tool for different joint variables. Structural analysis is carried out to determine the payload of the SCARA Robot using Ansys Workbench.
Kinematic analysis of the 4DOF SCARA robot was simulated using Robo Analyzer software.
At the end of this project, we came to a clear understanding of Robo Analyzer Software.
By using Robo Analyzer we obtained forward kinematics of the end effector of the robot for 
the given joint parameters.
By using graphs in Robo analyzer software we analyzed the change in joint angles with 
respect to time and the change in joint velocities with respect to time.
By inputting the Material used in the component and the Load value we got desired 
Deformation Value and Equivalent Stress of the end effector we concluded that the 
component should have a low deformation value to maintain accuracy in reaching the goal 
coordinates and the Tensile strength of the aluminium is in between 75 to 135 MPa and the 
loading stress should not cross beyond these values to maintain stability and accuracy.
For the given SCARA robot, the payload is determined using ANSYS WORKBENCH
